# EventPlanner Spring (2024) COP4710 - Database Systems
This project involves developing a web-based application that caters to university students by providing information about events on campus. Users can register and log in with different access levels: super admin, admin, and student. Super admins manage university profiles, while admins oversee registered student organizations (RSOs) and events. Students can view and interact with events but cannot create them. Students can view public events, private events at their university, and RSO events they are members of. They can rate, comment, and edit their comments for events.

Admins can create events with various details such as name, category, description, time, date, location, and contact information. Events can be public, private (visible only to students at the host university), or RSO-specific. RSOs can be created or joined by students with the same university email domain, and each RSO has at least one admin. Users can comment on and rate events, with social network integration options.

This application runs on a Digital Ocean Droplet following the LAMP stack framework for web application.
With Liunx/ Windows as the OS, 
    JavaScript as the frontend,
    MySQL as the Database server,
and PHP for API calls and most of the backend functionality.
